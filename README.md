This is my BloodDrive web project. The point of this project is for patients in need of blood donations can send a request to all nearby willing donors. 
All they have to do is fill a request form with their specifc information and the app will locate near by donors with the necessary blood type.
Donors can sign up to this website ,but must allow access to their location and they must sign up at their permenant place of residence.
Donors can log in so that they can update their location.

To run the code, open a terminal type
```
npm start
```
and open another terminal 
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
